# EXERCISE 7

Congratulations, console jockey.  You're about to punch deck and crack through the blackest ice in cyberspace. _*_

All you have to do is enter the secret word and untold riches (or at least some extra credit) are yours.

_*_ If you don't get any of these references, you should really read _Neuromancer_ by William Gibson.

## Instructions

I advise you to first examine the Security class in ./example.  The secret word for this file is `catfish`.  

```
(20109) $ java Security
Establishing connection to mainframe.....
Developing Visual Basic GUI to track IP.....
Decrypting mutexes for object-oriented analysis.....
ENTER SECRET WORD > loopback
ACCESS DENIED!!!
ENTER SECRET WORD > rabbit
ACCESS DENIED!!!
ENTER SECRET WORD > catfish
ACCESS GRANTED: CATFISH
```

There are three files, one for each class.  If you are in the Mon/Wed 11:00 class, use the one in the ./wed_11 subdirectory; in the Mon/Wed 1:00 class, the ./wed_1 subdirectory, and in the Tue/Thu 9:30 class, the ./thu_930 subdireector.

How should you figure it out?  That's up to you.

## Hints

1. Note that word entry is case-insensitive (i.e., it would have accepted `CATFISH` or `CaTfIsH` (but not, sadly, `c4tf15h`).
2. The word is an actual English word, although it may not be a common one.
3. There are a variety of ways to figure this out.  I urge you to "think outside the box" on this exercise.

# GRADING

If you can come up with the secret word and demonstrate it to me by the END OF CLASS, you will get +1 bonus point for D6.
